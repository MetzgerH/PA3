# Probing Hash Table

A probing hash table that rehashes at a customizable load factor (default 0.75, set by preprocessor directive).
Inserts and accesses in constant/O(1) time, unless the table needs to resize/rehash, which is done in linear/O(n) time where n is the new size of the table

Note that the contents of main.cpp is not my original work, as this was completed for an assignment, and that portion was provided. The rest is my own original work.
